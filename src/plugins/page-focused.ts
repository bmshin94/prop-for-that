/**
 * `--live-page-focused` (1/0) — whether the document currently has focus: the
 * tab is frontmost *and* its window is focused. Goes `0` when the user switches
 * to another tab, window, or app, and back to `1` on return. Driven by window
 * `focus`/`blur`, seeded from `document.hasFocus()`.
 *
 * Note: a blurred-but-still-visible window (e.g. clicking another app side by
 * side) keeps rAF alive, so the `0` flushes and CSS can react. Switching tabs
 * pauses rAF, so the change applies on return — invisible while hidden anyway.
